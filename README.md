# Course Project - Data Cleaning
##Create below mentioned tidy data sets for future analysis:

##(1) single train, test dataset with descriptive variable names
##(2) avg. of each variable & activity  per subject

## Following approach is considered for the project:
##Step 1 : Download raw data file from internet
##Step 2 : Collect meaningful Data sets into specific variables
##Step 3 : Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
##Step 4 : Modify, transform and merge dataset created earlier with  descriptive activity names for column headings and datasets
##Step 5 : Creat tidy dataset generated for each of subjects with mean & stanadrd deviation measurements for all parameters
##Step 6 : Create second tidy data set with average of each variable for each activity rand each subject 
##Step 8 : Upload tidy data set as text file with write.table(), raw.name=FALSE
